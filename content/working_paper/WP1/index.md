abstract: "Even though one in four women worldwide has experienced violence from an intimate
partner (IPV) at least once in their lifetime, some of the factors driving it remain
poorly understood. This study quantifies the impact of extreme temperatures on
IPV seasonality, with a particular focus on its increase during the summer months.
Using granular administrative data on IPV in Spain for the period 2006-2022, we find
that extreme heat leads to a 6% rise in total IPV offences, with a stronger increase
for severe cases. We explore several mechanisms, including increased time exposure
to the partner, changes in bargaining power and potential modifications in reporting
behaviour. Importantly, we also show that the effects are stronger in areas facing
substantial negative labour market shocks. Our projections indicate that a rise in
average summer temperatures would result in 181â€“363 additional IPV offences each
summer, emphasizing the role of climate resilience for the successful implementation
of IPV prevention strategies."
